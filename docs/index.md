# Welcome to `isotropic`

`isotropic` is a python package for isotropic error analysis in quantum computing. The library provides a comprehensive set of tools to model and generate isotropic errors to test their effect on various quantum algorithms.

Broadly this involves the following steps:

1. Construct an orthonormal basis of $\Pi$ with center at $\Phi$.
2. Generate a vector $e_2$ in $S_{dâˆ’1}$ with uniform distribution.
3. Generate an angle $\theta_0$ in $[0,\pi]$ with density function $f(\theta_0)$.
4. Generate the final perturbed state $\Psi$ as a rotation of $e_1 = \Phi$ by angle $\theta_0$ in the subspace spanned by the orthonormal basis $[e_1,e_2]$ using the expression
$$\Psi = \Phi \cos(\theta_0) + e_2 \sin(\theta_0)$$


## Installation

You can install `isotropic` from `pip` with:

```bash
pip install isotropic
```

If you want to test the effect of isotropic errors with one of the included quantum algorithm implementations, consider installing with the `all` option as such:

```bash
pip install isotropic\[all\]
```
